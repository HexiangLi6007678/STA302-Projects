# STA302-Projects

## Project Overview
This project investigates:
Which institutional features most strongly influence the Academic Reputation Score in the QS World University Rankings 2025?

Using a dataset of 1,500+ universities and 10+ institutional indicators, we apply a full statistical modeling workflow, including:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing

- Exploratory data analysis

- Multiple linear regression

- Lasso variable selection

- Stepwise AIC model refinement

- Box-Cox transformation

- Influential point diagnostics (Cook’s Distance, DFFITS, leverage)

- Final model inference and interpretation
